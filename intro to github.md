GitHub is a platform which is used to create and upload documents. It is a web-based application. Using GitHub, we can share file or code with other people who are working with us. On sharing a file in GitHub, we can easily collaborate with other people on projects. People who are working with us on a project can upload files, merge files and can make changes to these files. Basically GitHub helps in version control and gives the user information on who made what changes to the project. This is mainly useful when many people are woring on a project.

### 1.1 How I learnt about GIT today?

I created an account for GitHub by visiting [this site](github.com). There I was asked to enter my email, pick a username and create a password. After that I filled my profile. Later I installed GIT and used it to push files into my GitHub account. 

I created a new repository in my GitHub account and then in GIT, I moved to the directory in which files to be uploaded are present. 

Using **git init**, I initialized an empty GIT repository in my system. 

**git add "file name"** was used to add a particular file in the current directory to the Git repository while  **git add .** was used to add every file in the directory to Git repository.

**git commit -m "commit comment"** was used to commit this repository.

**git remote add origin <link to new repository>** was used to specify where to add this repository in my system.

**git push -u origin master** was used to push these files into my Git account

**git rm "file name"** can be used to remove a file from local Git repository and then after committing and pushing the same, the file will be removed from the Git account.

### 1.2 Coursemates I shared the document with.
I shared the file with Siddharth Tumre and Ravali Kuchibhotla.

### 1.3 What did we do together with the document after we shared it ?
Initially we worked on three different markdown files and then we add each our files into the coursemates repository.

### 1.4 How I shared the document with the other two students?
I asked them for their git usernames and gave them the access to my current repository by Settings->Manage Access-> and then adding their usernames for direct access.


### 1.5 What did the three of you do with the document ?
Initially we worked on three different markdown files and then we add each our files into the coursemates repository. After that I added my file to the repository of my coursemates by selecting upload files from the add file icon in the right top corner. We can also add to shared repositories by cloning and pushing the files with necessary changes.
